# Project: MNIST Character Recognition with Data Engineering and Modeling

# Description:
This GitHub repository showcases my journey through the MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset, a foundational dataset in computer vision. The repository is divided into two sprints, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project: data preprocessing and model building.

# Sprint 1: Create DataFrame from Raw Image Files
In this sprint, I tackle the task of preprocessing the MNIST image files and organizing them into a structured pandas dataframe. The MNIST dataset, renowned for handwritten character images, serves as an excellent benchmark for classification algorithms. I download and read the provided 'mnist_data.zip' to create a pandas dataframe. Furthermore, I leverage my Data Engineering skills to categorize each image into one of the 26 classes, enhancing the dataset's utility.

# Sprint 2: Build a Model
This sprint delves into the modeling aspect of the project. I perform data preprocessing on the raw image data, transforming it into numerical vectors that can be used for machine learning. Armed with the preprocessed data, I construct a model capable of recognizing characters from the images. The model's architecture and training process are documented here, providing insights into the steps taken to achieve successful character recognition.

Feel free to explore the code, documentation, and results presented in this repository. It serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in understanding the progression from data preprocessing to building a character recognition model using the MNIST dataset. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated!
